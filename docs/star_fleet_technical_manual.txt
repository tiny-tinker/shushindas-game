memorandum to: Franz Joseph Designs 


from: Col. Robert Argon, Director 
Security Control /L'FHQ 


date: 15 April 1973 
subject: KF Security Docket #0751L0 
enclosure: one (1) copy of subject docket 


1. Pursuant to youringuiry we are enclosing one (1) copy of subject 
docket without restrictions. The security classification has been 
removed, and there is no longer any official interest in the matter. 


2. The printed 'message' was: "ALERT.....ALERT. -UNITED FEDERATION 
FLEET HEADQUARTERS MASTER LIBRARY COMPUTER.....TO.....LIBRARY COMPUTER 
eeeeeALL FEDERATION STARSHIPS ON SPECIAL SERVICE.....STARDATE 3113..... 
«.TUANSLISSION OF UPDATED TECHNICAL MANUAL MASTER DATA SECTIONS 


«e+e eBEGIN TRANS! ISSION....." 


3. The message and the ‘data sheets’ which followed were found in the 
menory banks of the master computer at Security Control, Omaha MFB, 
and were accidentally discovered in 1970 during a print-out run, while the 

computer was teing interrogated for another reason. A top security lid 
was immediately clamped on the matter while an investigation was launched 
to attempt to identify the source of the unusual transmission. Neither 
the message or the data could be traced to any known country, or alliance, 
in the world. All of the terminology, uniforms, weaponry, and other 
material was completely foriegn to the terminology, uniforms, weaponry, 
and other material known to be in existence at that time. 


4. The investigation was terminated with a final determination that the 
whole affair had been a hoax. That the ‘unusual! material had been 
inserted into the computer as a prank. And the file was closed, while a 
search was initiated to find the person, or persons, responsible for this 
breach of Security Control. To date this effort has been fruitless.

1. Pursuant to the matter of the unauthorized transmission of SFAF 
material (viz: SFH2/éastercom Computer Data) into the Master Computer at 
Security Control, Omaha MFB, Earth, Sol System as of stardate 3113, the 
Special Review Board examined the following pertinent documentation: 


(a) report of Capt. Janes T. Kirk, comuanding, U.S.S. Enterprise; 

(b) report of Lt. Cndr. Spock, First Officer, U.S.S. Enterprise; 

(c) report of the investigation by the Special Review Commission; 

(a) report of the historical events sequential review of the data 
banks of Mastercom/SFHQ; 


2. The Special Review Board has now concluded its determination. It 
finds: (1) that both Capt. James T. Kirk and Lt. Ondr. Spock cannot be 
faulted for the matter since it occurred in the routine computer-to- 
computer transmission, which operates independently of the SFAF Comnunica- 
tions Systems or human supervision; and: (2) that it occurred as the 
result of an unpredicted, and unforeseen gravitational space-warp which 
is now known to be a natural phenomenon within the galaxy; and (3) that 
it was a purely random matter whicn occurred without human intervention 
and therefore is considered to be a natural accidental occurrence in the 
sequential train of historical events. 


3. The Special Review Board further finds that in the event the material 
now stored in the data banks of the Master Computer at Security Control, 
Qmaha MFB, should become known in that time period, it would be advisable 
to review whatever material is included in that storage to: (a) delete 
any technology which is not knom to Earth's technology in that time 
period, in order to preserve the Prire Directive's doctrine of non-inter- 
vention; and: (b) to correct any material which is determined to be "safe" 
but which was distorted in tne transrission. 


lk, Therefore, the Planetary Relations Division of Star Fleet Command is 
hereby assigned the task of this final determination in the event it should 
become necessary, and all Divisions shall support this effort as required. 
The Planetary Relations Division shall also prepare a final report upon 
‘the conclusion of any actions they may take, for submission to the Federa- 
tion Council.

1. A printed Terran version of the Star Fieet Technical Manual wes approved 
by the Federation Council for release to the civilians, and civilian auxiliaries on 
your planet. We have reviewed copies of this version as printed by you, and 
wish to assure you and the others that these copies are precisely correct 
and complete as authorized. We believe some of your civilians are confused 
because they are unfamiliar with the system and arrangement of Technical 
Orders, therefore, we offer the following by way of clarification. 


2. The print-out version of the Star Fleet Technical Manual, as used by the 
Star Fleet Academy. is a collection of only those Technical Orders necessary 
to the indoctrination of new cadets until such time as they have become 
experienced in the use of the data read-out stations of Mastercom/SFHG. 
Further, the Terran version contains even fewer Technical Orders because of 
the prohibition of the Prime Directive. Neither version is a "book" of “pages” 
as the questioners seem to think —nor do they contain “all” of the technical 
information stored in the data banks of Mastercom/SFHG. Your civilians 
must understand these technical data banks contain all the knowledge pres- 
ently known within the United Federation of Planets from all of the Member 
planets. If it were to be published in "book" form, the sum total would amount 
to more books than you now have stored in your “libraries:’ Obviously, this 
cannot be done. It is equally obvious that you cannot have the galactic knowl- 
edge of future centuries given to your planet as a “gift; you must earn it by 
your own efforts just as the others have done 


3. In the Terran version, the General Index summarizes the subject area 
groupings by Technical Order number blocks as a part of the total system of 
classification. It does not give the total classification system, nor does it indi- 
cate whether or not such subject matter is available. The Introduction 
(T.0:00:00:08) for instance. is not included because it has not been author- 
ized for release at this time. Each Section Index lists the Technical Orders 
currently approved for each section, and shows which are the correct issue 
by authentication date (and amendment code — if required). Thus a Section 
Index shows whether or not a particular Manual contains the correct issues. 
Those which are listed with an asterisk may become available in a future 
print-out from Mastercom/SFHG. Other Technical Order numbers which are 
missing do not appear by reason of the prohibition of the Prime Directive, or 
they have not been approved for release at this time. 


4. In as gentle and as diplomatic manner as we may, we should like to point 
out that this confusion is just another example of the many primitive attri- 
butes of your planet which prevent its acceptance into the United Federa- 
tion of Planets at this time in your current calendar. But be patient, the day 
will come in the future when your planet will have finally overcome these 
obstacles, and will take its place in the intergalactic community of intelligent 
life forms. 


Live long and prosper.

SYSTEMS, AND 


TO REAFFIRM FAITH IN THE FUNDAMENTAL INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORM RIGHTS, IN 
THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF THE INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORM PERSON, TO THE EQUAL

LAW CAN BE MAINTAINED, AND 

TO PROMOTE SOCIAL PROGRESS AND BETTER STANDARDS OF LIFE IN LARGER

ANOTHER AS GOOD NEIGHBORS, AND 

TO UNITE OUR STRENGTH TO MAINTAIN INTRA-GALACTIC PEACE AND SECURITY,

HAVE RESOLVED TO COMBINE OUR EFFORTS 
TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS. 


ACCORDINGLY, THE RESPECTIVE SOCIAL SYSTEMS, THROUGH REPRESENTATIVES

PURPOSES ANDO PRINCIPLES 


ARTICLE 1 
THE PURPOSES OF THE UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS ARE: 


1. TO MAINTAIN INTERPLANETARY PEACE AND SECURITY WITHIN THE TREATY EXPLORA- 
TION TERRITORY, AND TO THAT END: TO TAKE EFFECTIVE COLLECTIVE MEASURES FOR 
THE PREVENTION OF THREATS TO THE PEACE, THE SUPPRESSION OF ACTS OF AGGRES- 
SION, AND TO BRING ABOUT BY PEACEFUL MEANS, AND EMPLOYING THE PRINCIPLES OF 
JUSTICE AND INTRA-GALACTIC LAW, ADJUSTMENT OR SETTLEMENT OF INTERPLANETARY, 
DISPUTES WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO A BREACH OF THE PEACE; 


2. TO DEVELOP FRIENDLY RELATIONS AMONG PLANETS BASED ON RESPECT FOR THE 
PRINCIPLES OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND SELF-DETERMINATION OF INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORMS, 
AND TO OTHER APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN UNIVERSAL PEACE; 


3. TO ACHIEVE INTERPLANETARY COOPERATION IN SOLVING INTRA-GALACTIC PROBLEMS 
OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, CULTURAL, OR HUMANITARIAN CHARACTER; IN PROMOTING AND 
ENCOURAGING RESPECT FOR INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORM RIGHTS; AND FOR FUNDAMENTAL, 
FREEDOMS FOR ALL WITHOUT DISTINCTION AS TO CULTURE, SEX, LIFE-FORM, OR
